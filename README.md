# Pet Health Club

Welcome to the Pet Health Club project! This is a collaborative effort to create a cute application aimed at monitoring the health of critters. The application operates through the web, facilitating the transfer of information from an ESP board to the backend server. This includes data such as the pulse rate, heart rate, and temperature of your beloved critters.

Pet Health Club allows users to customize their configurations for monitoring their pets' health. Users can build their own configurations tailored to their pets' specific needs and preferences. This includes the flexibility to use different sensors based on their requirements.

## Current Status
The project is currently in the initializing phase. Development efforts are focused on setting up the foundational elements on the server side and a firmware for ESP boards.

## Features
- **Web Interface:** Users can access the application through a web interface for ease of monitoring their pets' health.
- **ESP Board Integration:** The application integrates with an ESP board to gather real-time data on pet health parameters.
- **Data Transfer:** Information collected from the ESP board is securely transmitted to the backend server for processing and storage.
- **Health Monitoring:** Users can view their pets' pulse rate, heart rate, and temperature through the application.
- **Alerts:** The application will provide alerts to users in case of any abnormalities detected in their pets' health parameters.

## Download
